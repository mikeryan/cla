# ICE9 Consulting LLC CLA Repository

This repository contains the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) that
you must sign before your contributions will be accepted to certain
projects published by Mike Ryan and ICE9 Consulting LLC. If a project
requires the CLA to be signed before submissions will be accepted, this
fact will be noted in the project's README. Additionally, a CLA helper
GitHub action will automatically run on all pull requests and ask for
the signatures of all contributors before the pull requests can be
merged.

If you have any questions about this agreement, please email
info@ice9.us.
